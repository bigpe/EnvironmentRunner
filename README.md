## Environment Runner

Run what your want if env variable and same name script exist, easy to scale, simplify bootstrap pipelines

Tired of writing scripts to start servers? ðŸ« 

Do you want to be able to easily manage the process so that you can disable some scripts from the general script at any time? ðŸ¥°

#### Two easy steps:

- Create .sh script and drop at runner folder
- Export ENV by template RUNNER_NAME_OF_SCRIPT_UPPERCASE=1

Simple example (if it's still not clear)
-

```shell
export RUNNER_DO_SOMETHING=1

```

To disable runner for script just unset or set value to 0

```shell
export RUNNER_DO_SOMETHING=0
```
```shell
unset RUNNER_DO_SOMETHING
```
